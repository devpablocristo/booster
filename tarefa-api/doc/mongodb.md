### Step 1: Create an Account on MongoDB Atlas

1. Go to the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Click on "Try Free" or "Get started for free" to create a free account.
3. Fill in the necessary information to create your account and follow the instructions to confirm your account via email.

### Step 2: Set Up a Cluster in MongoDB Atlas

1. After logging in to your MongoDB Atlas account, click on "Build a Cluster".
2. Choose the free configuration (M0 Sandbox) or any other configuration you prefer.
3. Configure the region and cloud provider you want.
4. Click on "Create Cluster" and wait for the creation to complete.

### Step 3: Configure Database Access

1. In the left menu, click on "Database Access".
2. Add a new user with a secure username and password. This user will be used in your project to connect to the database.

### Step 4: Configure Allowed IP Address

1. In the left menu, click on "Network Access".
2. Add an allowed IP address (0.0.0.0/0 to allow any IP). This is useful during development, but in production, you should limit allowed IPs.

### Step 5: Obtain the Connection String

To use MongoDB in your application, you need at least the following minimum variables:

1. **Connection String:** This is the address your application will use to connect to the MongoDB database. It should include information such as the username, password, MongoDB server address, and port.
   - `<username>`: The username you have configured in MongoDB.
   - `<password>`: The password associated with the user.
   - `<server>`: The MongoDB server address, which can be a hostname or an IP address.
   - `<port>`: The port MongoDB is listening on (default is 27017).
   - `<database>`: The name of the database you want to connect to.

2. **Database Name:** You need to know the name of the database you are connecting to in MongoDB. This is specified in the connection string.

3. **Credentials:** You need a valid username and password to access the MongoDB database you are connecting to. These credentials must match the ones configured on your MongoDB server.

These are the minimum variables required to use MongoDB in your application. However, depending on your specific configuration and the library you are using to interact with MongoDB in your programming language (such as the MongoDB driver for Go), you may need to configure other options, such as authentication, access control, and more.

1. In the left menu, click on "Clusters".
2. Click on "Connect" for your cluster.
3. Select "Connect your application".
4. Copy the provided connection string. It should look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database>
   ```

### Step 6: Create Your Go Project

1. Create a new Go project in the directory of your choice.
2. Make sure you have the `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo` library imported in your project. You can add it with the command `go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo`.

### Step 7: Use the MongoDB Adapter

1. Copy the MongoDB adapter code that we have generated for your project.
2. Make sure to replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster>`, and `<database>` in the connection string with the information you obtained in Step 5.
3. Use the adapter in your project to interact with MongoDB Atlas.
